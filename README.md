I would normally use LaTeX for this, but I took this as an opportunity to try Typst. It's nice. This could also be a Python utility that syncs with the time on the machine, but this format seems a lot more popular.

The margins are a bit weird to make this look better on the Supernote screen. Consider changing them.
